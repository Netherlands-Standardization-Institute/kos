# NEN Knowledge Organization System

The NEN Knowledge Organization System describes a data model for standardisation bodies based on SKOS. It consists of:

- the [International Classification for Standards](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100033.html),
- a catalog with standard documents,
- and a controlled vocabulary with terms and definitions.

It aims to create a datamodel for normalized terms and definitions that can be easily published using [Skosmos](https://skosmos.org).

### Publishing terms and definitions as Linked Open Data
Below we list a number of resources to help other standard bodies publish their terms and definitions as Linked Open Data.

  - [Excel2RDF](https://github.com/fair-data-collective/excel2rdf-template): Convert and Excel template to RDF
  - [XML2CSV](https://github.com/Netherlands-Standardization-Institute/xml2csv): Extract terms and definitions from XML using the NISO STS
  - [Skosmos](https://skosmos.org): View terms using an open source web-based SKOS browser and publishing tool
  - [NEN controlled vocabulary](https://github.com/Netherlands-Standardization-Institute/controlled-vocabulary): Example of controlled vocabularies from the [NEN](https://nen.nl)
